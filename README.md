# Predicting Fetal Health: A Comprehensive Classification Study
---
### Introduction
In the realm of fetal health classification, we embark on a vital mission to predict the well-being of unborn infants, and this task carries immense weight, touching the lives of expectant mothers and the most vulnerable among us. Our journey begins with a meticulous analysis of a comprehensive fetal health classification dataset—a treasure trove of 2126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams. These records were carefully classified into three classes: "Normal," "Suspect," and "Pathological" by three expert obstetricians, whose expertise and insights are invaluable in shaping our understanding of fetal health.
